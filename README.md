### A brief history of Javascript

A simple set of projects that demonstrate the core problems Javascript has been trying to solve since it's conception;
when a user interaction takes place, make an xhr request and display the reponse data on a page without refresh or forced navigation.

THe goal is to help developers and stakeholders understand and pick the appropriate frontend technology for their projects using a fact based approach rather than individual developer preference.
